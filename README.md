# Note-Taker

## Description

This application was created so user can store notes, review notes and delete their notes all with the power of nodejs and express.


## Installation
To run the application the first step is to clone the repository from github and then make sure that you have nodejs installed on your local device, the link to the documentation and download link of nodejs is [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After having nodejs installed and this repository is downloaded down to your local device, then you will want to navigate towards the directory using the command line and run this line of code 
```bash
npm install 
```
This bash command will automatically install all of the node packages that are essential in this program and will then make the application runnable. Since this application strictly uses node and javascript (outside of the generated website) there is no website for the deployed application and to actually use the application, you will have to run the application through the command line and the way you do this is by running this command line in terminal/bash 
```bash
node app.js
```

## User Story
